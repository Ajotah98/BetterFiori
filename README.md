## Overview

Better Fiori is a project developed to enhance the experience of reporting hours for individuals who are required to report their working hours in SAP Fiori. SAP Fiori, primarily a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool, is not inherently designed for time reporting purposes. This project addresses the need for a more intuitive and focused tool for time reporting, leveraging the SQLPage framework and SQL programming to offer a seamless and efficient alternative.
## Why Better Fiori?

The inception of Better Fiori was driven by the inconvenience faced by users who had to report their hours in SAP Fiori. Recognizing that SAP Fiori, while excellent for CRM functionalities, falls short in providing a user-friendly time reporting interface, Better Fiori aims to fill this gap. It not only simplifies the process of time reporting but also includes a notification feature to remind users if they have not reported their hours for the previous day. This proactive approach ensures compliance with time reporting policies and assists users in maintaining their schedules efficiently.
